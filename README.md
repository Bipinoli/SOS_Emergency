# SOS_Emergency
Provide one button help at emergency.

This is the app we built in KU IT Meet 2017 hackathon.
The theme of the hackathon was crime control.

Crime can be of many forms from pickpocketing to murder. They vary in severity and emergency. Current system handles crime quite efficiently but there is no special solution to avoid the crime in the first place. So our app focuses in this crucial challenge.
That is we provide support for emergency. Our app is not a separate system in itself but a better framework for the proper authorities like police. 

Our app mainatains the database of all the crime activities cum prevented crime. It can do all sorts of awesome things with that database like visualizing the crime dynamics, marking the dangerous place on user's geomap. Provide the safest feasible route from origin to destination. 

And above all the most crucial feature of our app is SOS button. While at emergency user can mimick that button press with the volume and power button combination or they can directley press SOS button inside app. After the button is pressed it sends the sms to the emergency contact along with alerting the police around that geolocation. This reduces the overhead so crucial for the emergency situation.
